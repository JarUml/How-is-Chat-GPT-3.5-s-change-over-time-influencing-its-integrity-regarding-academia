    2371 ÷ 6 = 395.1667 (not a whole number)
    2371 ÷ 7 = 338.7143 (not a whole number)
    2371 ÷ 8 = 296.375 (not a whole number)
    2371 ÷ 9 = 263.4444 (not a whole number)
    2371 ÷ 10 = 237.1 (not a whole number)
    ...
    2371 ÷ 49 = 48.3878 (not a whole number)

We have checked all the numbers up to 49, and none of them evenly divide 2371. Therefore, there are no divisors other than 1 and 2371 itself.

So, the answer is "[Yes]." 2371 is a prime number.

#2467

To determine if 2467 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start with the number 2, which is the first prime number.
    Divide 2467 by 2. If it's divisible evenly (i.e., without a remainder), then it's not a prime number.

Now, let's perform the division:

2467 ÷ 2 = 1233.5

Since 2467 divided by 2 equals 1233.5, which is not a whole number (it has a decimal part), it means that 2467 is not divisible evenly by 2.

Now, we need to continue checking divisibility by numbers greater than 2 but less than the square root of 2467. The square root of 2467 is approximately 49.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

    Check divisibility by numbers from 3 to 49:

2467 is not divisible by 3 (because the sum of its digits, 2 + 4 + 6 + 7, is not divisible by 3).
2467 is not divisible by 5 (because it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
2467 is not divisible by 7 (after dividing, you will get a remainder).

Since we have checked divisibility by all numbers from 2 to 49 and found that 2467 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that:

[Yes], 2467 is a prime number.

#2531

To determine if 2531 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Find the square root of 2531, which is approximately 50.31.
    Check if 2531 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

Now, let's check if 2531 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root:

    2531 is not divisible by 2 because it's an odd number.
    2531 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (2 + 5 + 3 + 1) is not divisible by 3.
    2531 is not divisible by 5 because it doesn't end in 0 or 5.
    We can skip checking divisibility by 7 because 7 * 7 = 49 is already greater than 2531.

Since we have checked for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 2531 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 2531 is a prime number.

So, the answer is: [Yes]

#2609

To determine if 2609 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by testing divisibility by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 2609, which is approximately 51.

Let's perform the step-by-step divisibility test:

    Is 2609 divisible by 2? (2609 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2) - No
    Is 2609 divisible by 3? (2 + 6 + 0 + 9 = 17, and 17 is not divisible by 3) - No
    Is 2609 divisible by 5? (It doesn't end in 0 or 5) - No
    Is 2609 divisible by 7? (You would need to perform long division to check this, or you can note that 2609 is not obviously divisible by 7) - No
    Continue checking divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 2609, which is approximately 51. None of these numbers will divide evenly into 2609.

Since we haven't found any divisors other than 1 and 2609, we can conclude that 2609 is a prime number.

So, the answer is: [Yes]

#2699

To determine if 2699 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start by checking if it's divisible by 2. If it's even, then it's not prime because all even numbers greater than 2 are divisible by 2. If it's odd, proceed to the next step.

    Check if it's divisible by any odd integers from 3 up to the square root of 2699 (rounded up to the nearest whole number). If it's divisible by any of these numbers, then it's not prime. If it's not divisible by any of them, then it's prime.

Let's perform the calculations:

    2699 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), so we proceed to the next step.

    Calculate the square root of 2699, which is approximately 52.0 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Now, we check if 2699 is divisible by any odd integers from 3 to 52:

    2699 is not divisible by 3.
    2699 is not divisible by 5.
    2699 is not divisible by 7.
    2699 is not divisible by 11.
    2699 is not divisible by 13.
    2699 is not divisible by 17.
    2699 is not divisible by 19.
    2699 is not divisible by 23.
    2699 is not divisible by 29.
    2699 is not divisible by 31.
    2699 is not divisible by 37.
    2699 is not divisible by 41.
    2699 is not divisible by 43.
    2699 is not divisible by 47.
    2699 is not divisible by 53.

Since we have checked all the way up to the square root of 2699 (rounded up), and none of these numbers evenly divide 2699, we can conclude that 2699 is not divisible by any integers other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the answer is:

[Yes]

#2797

[Yes]

#2861
To determine if 2861 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 2861.
2861 ÷ 2 = 1430 with a remainder of 1.

Since there is a remainder when dividing 2861 by 2, we know that 2 is not a divisor of 2861.

Step 2: Check if 3 is a divisor of 2861.
To do this, we can add up the digits of 2861 and check if the result is divisible by 3.
2 + 8 + 6 + 1 = 17
17 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Continue checking for divisors by testing numbers from 4 and onwards, but we can stop here because 2861 is an odd number greater than 1, and we've already checked for divisibility by 2 and 3.

Since we haven't found any divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude:

[Yes], 2861 is a prime number.


#2909
To determine if 2909 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

    Start by finding the square root of 2909. The square root of 2909 is approximately 53.90 (rounded to two decimal places).

    Now, check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to 53 (since any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root):
        2 is not a divisor of 2909 (because it's an odd number).
        3 is not a divisor of 2909 (the sum of its digits, 2 + 9 + 0 + 9, is not divisible by 3).
        5 is not a divisor of 2909 (because it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
        7 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        11 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        13 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        17 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        19 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        23 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        29 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        31 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        37 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        41 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        43 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        47 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).
        53 is not a divisor of 2909 (you can check this by long division, and it doesn't evenly divide).

Since none of these prime numbers from 2 to 53 are divisors of 2909, we can conclude that 2909 has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the answer is:

[Yes]

#3037
To determine if 3037 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by performing a step-by-step prime factorization:

    Start by dividing 3037 by 2.
    3037 ÷ 2 = 1518 with a remainder of 1

    Since 3037 is not divisible by 2 (the remainder is 1), we move on to the next potential divisor, which is 3.

    Divide 3037 by 3.
    3037 ÷ 3 = 1012 with a remainder of 1

    Again, 3037 is not divisible by 3 (the remainder is 1). We continue to the next potential divisor, which is 5.

    Divide 3037 by 5.
    3037 ÷ 5 = 607 with no remainder

Now, we have reached a point where we cannot divide 3037 by any smaller prime number without getting a remainder. Therefore, we have considered all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3037, and none of them evenly divide 3037.

So, the final answer is:

[Yes]

3037 is a prime number.

#3169

To determine if 3169 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start with the number 2, which is the smallest prime number.
    Divide 3169 by 2. If it's evenly divisible (i.e., there is no remainder), then it's not a prime number.

Let's calculate:

3169 ÷ 2 = 1584 with a remainder of 1

Since there is a remainder of 1 when dividing 3169 by 2, we know that 3169 is not divisible by 2.

    Continue checking for divisibility by increasing prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...) up to the square root of 3169, which is approximately 56.25.

Let's check a few more prime numbers:

3169 ÷ 3 = 1056 with a remainder of 1
3169 ÷ 5 = 633 with a remainder of 4
3169 ÷ 7 = 452 with a remainder of 5
3169 ÷ 11 = 288 with a remainder of 1
3169 ÷ 13 = 244 with a remainder of 7

We can continue this process, but as we can see, none of the prime numbers up to the square root of 3169 divide it evenly.

    Therefore, based on these calculations, we can conclude that 3169 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root.

    So, the final answer is:

[Yes]

3169 is a prime number.

#4073

To determine whether 4073 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Find the square root of 4073:
    √4073 ≈ 63.76

    Check divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 4073. The prime numbers less than or equal to 63 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, and 59.

    Divide 4073 by each of these prime numbers to see if it's divisible:
        4073 ÷ 2 = 2036.5 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 3 = 1357.67 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 5 = 814.6 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 7 = 581.857 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 11 = 370.273 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 13 = 313.307 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 17 = 239.588 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 19 = 214.368 (not a whole number)
        4073 ÷ 23 = 177 (a whole number)

Since 4073 is divisible by 23 and not by any of the other prime numbers less than or equal to its square root, it is not a prime number.

So the answer is: [No]

#5281

To determine if 5281 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by testing divisibility by numbers from 2 to the square root of 5281 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

The square root of 5281 is approximately 72.65. So, we'll check divisibility by numbers from 2 to 73.

Let's go through the steps:

    Is 5281 divisible by 2? (5281 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2) - No

    Is 5281 divisible by 3? (The sum of the digits of 5281 is 5 + 2 + 8 + 1 = 16, and 16 is not divisible by 3) - No

    Is 5281 divisible by 5? (The last digit is 1, which is not 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5) - No

    Is 5281 divisible by 7? (You would need to perform long division to check this, but 5281 is not divisible by 7) - No

    Continue checking divisibility by numbers up to 73.

After checking divisibility by numbers up to 73, we find that 5281 is not divisible by any of these numbers. Therefore, there are no divisors other than 1 and itself.

So, the answer is:

[Yes]

#6131

To determine if 6131 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself. We'll do this by checking for divisors between 2 and the square root of 6131, rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The square root of 6131 is approximately 78.27. So, we will check for divisors from 2 to 78.

Let's go through the numbers one by one:

    6131 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

    6131 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (6 + 1 + 3 + 1) is 11, and 11 is not divisible by 3.

    6131 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in 0 or 5.

    6131 is not divisible by 7 because there is no simple pattern to check for divisibility by 7, and we can confirm that 6131 is not evenly divisible by 7 by doing the division.

    6131 is not divisible by 11 because the alternating sum of its digits (6 - 1 + 3 - 1) is not divisible by 11.

    6131 is not divisible by 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, or 73.

Now, we have checked all the numbers up to the square root of 6131, and none of them are divisors of 6131. Therefore, there are no divisors of 6131 other than 1 and 6131 itself.

So, the answer is:

[Yes]

6131 is a prime number.

#6737

To determine if 6737 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by testing for divisibility by all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 6737, because if a number is divisible by a larger number, it would also be divisible by one of the smaller prime numbers.

The square root of 6737 is approximately 82.12, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 82.

Let's check:

    Is 6737 divisible by 2? No, because it is an odd number.
    Is 6737 divisible by 3? No, because the sum of its digits is 6 + 7 + 3 + 7 = 23, and 23 is not divisible by 3.

After checking divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 6737, we can conclude that 6737 is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, the answer is:

[Yes]

#7237
To determine if 7237 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

    Start by finding the square root of 7237. The square root of 7237 is approximately 85.05.

    Now, check if 7237 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (i.e., prime numbers less than or equal to 85).

    a. Check if it's divisible by 2. 7237 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.

    b. Check if it's divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 7 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 19, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 7237 is not divisible by 3.

    c. Check if it's divisible by 5. It doesn't end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.

    d. Check if it's divisible by 7. We need to do the actual division to check for divisibility by 7:

    7237 ÷ 7 = 1047

    Since 7237 is not evenly divisible by 7 (there's a remainder), it's not divisible by 7.

    Continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers greater than 7 and less than or equal to the square root (85).

    We don't need to check for divisibility by any more prime numbers because we have already checked up to 7, and 7237 is not divisible by any of them.

Since we have checked for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 7237 and found that it's not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 7237 is a prime number.

[Yes]

#8761
To determine if 8761 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the square root of 8761. The square root of 8761 is approximately 93.58 (rounded up to two decimal places).

Step 2: Check for divisors starting from 2 up to the square root value (93.58).

Let's check if 8761 is divisible by any integer from 2 to 93.58:

    8761 is not divisible by 2 because it's an odd number.
    8761 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (8 + 7 + 6 + 1) is 22, and 22 is not divisible by 3.
    8761 is not divisible by 5 because it doesn't end in 0 or 5.
    8761 is not divisible by 7 because there is no immediate evident pattern of repeating digits or multiples of 7.
    Continue checking divisibility for integers from 8 to 93.58.

After checking divisibility for these numbers, we can conclude that 8761 is not divisible by any integer from 2 to 93.58.

Therefore, the answer is:

[Yes]

#9157

To determine if 9157 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 9157.

9157 is an odd number, and 2 is an even number. Odd numbers are not divisible by even numbers, so 2 is not a divisor of 9157.

Step 2: Continue by checking odd numbers as potential divisors.

Let's check odd numbers starting from 3 and going up to the square root of 9157, which is approximately 95.7 (rounded up to 96 for simplicity).

3 is not a divisor of 9157.
5 is not a divisor of 9157.
7 is not a divisor of 9157.
...
and so on, until we reach 95.

Step 3: Since we have checked all potential divisors up to the square root of 9157 and none of them divided evenly into 9157, we can conclude that 9157 has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

So, the answer is:

[Yes]

9157 is a prime number.

#9497

To determine if 9497 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start by checking if 9497 is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. If it is, then it's not a prime number.

    If it's not divisible by 2, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers from 3 upwards to the square root of 9497. If we find any such divisor, then it's not a prime number.

Let's check:

    9497 is not divisible by 2 because it's an odd number.

    We will check divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3:
        9497 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is not divisible by 3).
        9497 is not divisible by 5 (ends with 5, but not 0 or 5).
        9497 is not divisible by 7 (you can use long division or check for a remainder).
        9497 is not divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits is not divisible by 11).
        9497 is not divisible by 13.
        9497 is not divisible by 17.
        9497 is not divisible by 19.
        9497 is not divisible by 23.
        9497 is not divisible by 29.
        9497 is not divisible by 31.

We have checked up to the square root of 9497 (which is approximately 97.46). Since we did not find any divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude:

[Yes]

9497 is a prime number.

#9643

To determine if 9643 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Here's the step-by-step process:

    Start by checking if 9643 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

    If it's not divisible by 2, we can move on to checking divisibility by odd numbers greater than 2. We don't need to check divisibility by any even number greater than 2 because if a number is divisible by an even number other than 2, it would also be divisible by 2.

    Calculate the square root of 9643, which is approximately 98.20. We only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to this square root.

    Now, start checking divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to 98 (since we've already ruled out divisibility by 2).

Let's perform the divisibility check for 9643:

    9643 is not divisible by 2 (remainder is 1).
    9643 is not divisible by 3 (remainder is 1).
    9643 is not divisible by 5 (remainder is 3).
    9643 is not divisible by 7 (remainder is 2).

    9643 is not divisible by 89 (remainder is 65).
    9643 is not divisible by 97 (remainder is 51).

After checking divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 9643, we can conclude that there are no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the answer is:

[Yes]

9643 is a prime number.

#10039

To determine if 10039 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start by checking if it's divisible by 2. If it's an even number (ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), then it's not prime. However, 10039 is an odd number, so we move on to the next step.

    Check for divisibility by odd numbers from 3 onwards, up to the square root of 10039. In this case, the square root of 10039 is approximately 100.2, so we only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to 101.

Let's check if 10039 is divisible by any of these odd numbers:

    3: 10039 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 9) is 13, and 13 is not divisible by 3.

    5: 10039 is not divisible by 5 because it doesn't end in 0 or 5.

    7: We can perform long division to check if 10039 is divisible by 7:
    10039 ÷ 7 = 1434 remainder 1
    Since there is a remainder of 1, 10039 is not divisible by 7.

    11: We can also perform long division to check if 10039 is divisible by 11:
    10039 ÷ 11 = 912 remainder 7
    Again, there is a remainder, so 10039 is not divisible by 11.

    13: Long division for 13:
    10039 ÷ 13 = 772 remainder 3
    Since there is a remainder of 3, 10039 is not divisible by 13.

    17: Long division for 17:
    10039 ÷ 17 = 590 remainder 9
    There is a remainder of 9, so 10039 is not divisible by 17.

    19: Long division for 19:
    10039 ÷ 19 = 528 remainder 7
    Once again, there is a remainder, so 10039 is not divisible by 19.

Since we've checked for divisibility by all odd numbers up to the square root of 10039 and found that it's not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 10039 is a prime number.

So, the answer is: [Yes]

#10159
To determine whether 10159 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start with the number 10159.
    Find its factors by checking divisibility by numbers from 2 to the square root of 10159, rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Let's calculate the square root of 10159:

√10159 ≈ 100.796

So, we will check divisibility up to 101 (the nearest whole number greater than the square root).

Now, let's check if 10159 is divisible by any number from 2 to 101:

    10159 ÷ 2 = 5079.5 (not a whole number)
    10159 ÷ 3 = 3386.333... (not a whole number)
    10159 ÷ 4 = 2539.75 (not a whole number)
    10159 ÷ 5 = 2031.8 (not a whole number)
    10159 ÷ 6 = 1693.166... (not a whole number)
    ...
    10159 ÷ 100 = 101.59 (not a whole number)
    10159 ÷ 101 = 100.59 (not a whole number)

Since none of the divisions resulted in whole numbers, we can conclude that there are no positive integer factors of 10159 other than 1 and 10159 itself. Therefore, 10159 is a prime number.

So, the answer is: [Yes]

#10427

To determine if 10427 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any whole number other than 1 and itself.

    Start by checking if it's divisible by 2:
    10427 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.

    Next, check if it's divisible by any odd numbers from 3 onwards:
    We don't need to check divisibility by every odd number up to 10427. Instead, we can check divisibility up to the square root of 10427 (which is approximately 102.12). If we don't find any divisors up to the square root, we won't find any beyond it either.

Let's do the calculations:

    10427 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 7 = 14, and 14 is not divisible by 3.

    We can continue checking divisibility by other prime numbers, but it's not necessary because we've already checked up to the square root of 10427.

Since we haven't found any whole number divisors other than 1 and itself, we can conclude that 10427 is a prime number.

[Yes]

#11497

To determine if 11497 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start with the number 2.
    Check if 11497 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
    If it's not divisible by 2, move on to the next prime number, which is 3.
    Check if 11497 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it's not a prime number.
    Continue this process, checking divisibility by prime numbers in ascending order (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...) until you reach a prime number that is greater than the square root of 11497.

Now, let's go through the steps:

    11497 is not divisible by 2 (because it's an odd number).
    11497 is not divisible by 3 (because the sum of its digits is not divisible by 3).
    11497 is not divisible by 5.
    11497 is not divisible by 7.
    11497 is not divisible by 11.
    11497 is not divisible by 13.
    11497 is not divisible by 17.
    11497 is not divisible by 19.
    The next prime number to check is 23, but 23 is greater than the square root of 11497.

Since we have checked divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 11497 and found no divisors, we can conclude that 11497 is prime.

So, the answer is "[Yes]." 11497 is a prime number.


#11927
To determine if 11927 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

    We can start by checking if it's divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. If a number is even (ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is divisible by 2. In this case, 11927 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2.

    Next, we can check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3 and going up. We don't need to check numbers higher than the square root of 11927 because if there are no divisors smaller than or equal to the square root, there won't be any larger divisors either.

Let's do the calculations:

    11927 is not divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits is not a multiple of 3).
    11927 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).
    11927 is not divisible by 7 (you can try long division, and you'll find that it doesn't evenly divide).

Now, we'll check numbers up to the square root of 11927, which is approximately 109.27:

    11927 is not divisible by 11.
    11927 is not divisible by 13.
    11927 is not divisible by 17.
    11927 is not divisible by 19.
    11927 is not divisible by 23.
    11927 is not divisible by 29.
    11927 is not divisible by 31.
    11927 is not divisible by 37.
    11927 is not divisible by 41.
    11927 is not divisible by 43.
    11927 is not divisible by 47.
    11927 is not divisible by 53.
    11927 is not divisible by 59.
    11927 is not divisible by 61.
    11927 is not divisible by 67.
    11927 is not divisible by 71.
    11927 is not divisible by 73.
    11927 is not divisible by 79.
    11927 is not divisible by 83.
    11927 is not divisible by 89.
    11927 is not divisible by 97.

Since we've checked all prime numbers up to the square root of 11927 and found no divisors, we can conclude:

[Yes], 11927 is a prime number.

#12163

To determine if 12163 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

    Start by finding the square root of 12163:
    √12163 ≈ 110.39

    Next, we'll check for divisors from 2 up to the square root (110) of 12163 to see if any of them evenly divide 12163.

Let's check:

    12163 ÷ 2 = 6081.5 (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 3 = 4054.333... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 4 = 3040.75 (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 5 = 2432.6 (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 6 = 2027.166... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 7 = 1737.571... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 8 = 1520.375 (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 9 = 1351.444... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 10 = 1216.3 (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 11 = 1105.727... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 12 = 1013.583... (not a whole number)
    12163 ÷ 13 = 935.615... (not a whole number)

It appears that none of the numbers from 2 to 110 evenly divide 12163.

So, after checking all the possible divisors up to the square root of 12163, we can conclude that 12163 is not divisible by any other integer except 1 and itself.

Therefore, the answer is:

To determine if 13049 is a prime number, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

    Start by checking if 2 is a divisor of 13049. Since 13049 is an odd number (ends in 9), it's not divisible by 2.

    Next, check if 3 is a divisor. The sum of the digits of 13049 is 1 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 9 = 17, and 17 is not divisible by 3.

    Continue checking for divisors up to the square root of 13049, which is approximately 114. Any potential divisors beyond this point would have corresponding divisors that have already been checked.

    Check if 5 is a divisor. 13049 is not divisible by 5.

    Check if 7 is a divisor. 13049 is not divisible by 7.

    Check if 11 is a divisor. 13049 is not divisible by 11.

    Check if 13 is a divisor. 13049 is not divisible by 13.

    Check if 17 is a divisor. 13049 is not divisible by 17.

    Continue this process for divisors up to the square root of 13049.

Since we have checked all potential divisors up to the square root of 13049 and none of them divide evenly into 13049, we can conclude that 13049 is a prime number.

So, the answer is "[Yes]."

#14983

To determine if 14983 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

    Start with the number 2, which is the smallest prime number.
    Check if 14983 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
    If 14983 is not divisible by 2, move on to the next prime number, which is 3.
    Check if 14983 is divisible by 3. If it is, then it's not a prime number.
    Continue this process for each prime number up to the square root of 14983. If you find any prime number that divides 14983 without leaving a remainder, then 14983 is not a prime number.

Let's perform these steps:

    14983 is not divisible by 2 (14983 % 2 != 0).
    14983 is not divisible by 3 (14983 % 3 != 0).
    We can skip checking 14983 against the other even numbers greater than 2 because it's already not divisible by 2.

Now, we need to check the odd prime numbers:

    14983 is not divisible by 5 (14983 % 5 != 0).
    14983 is not divisible by 7 (14983 % 7 != 0).
    14983 is not divisible by 11 (14983 % 11 != 0).

We can continue this process, but it's clear that there are no prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 14983 that divide 14983 without leaving a remainder. Therefore, we can conclude:
